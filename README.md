# Flight-Price-Prediction

This repository holds the code and analysis for predicting flight ticket prices using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering techniques.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that accurately predicts flight ticket prices based on various factors such as date, time, origin, destination, airline, duration, stops, etc. By understanding the relationships between these features and prices, we can build a model that can help travelers make informed decisions about booking flights.

Data & Tools
Data source: (Specify the dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, airline website).
Software libraries: (List the Python libraries used, e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn).


EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Data Exploration:
Analyze data distribution for features like price, origin-destination pairs, airlines, date/time etc.
Visualize trends and patterns using appropriate graphs (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, boxplots).
Identify potential outliers and missing values.
Feature Analysis:
Calculate descriptive statistics for numerical features (mean, median, standard deviation).
Analyze the distribution of categorical features (frequency tables, cross-tabulations).
Explore correlations between features and price.


Feature Engineering
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values (imputation, deletion).
Outlier treatment (winsorization, clipping).
Encode categorical features (one-hot encoding, label encoding).

Feature Creation:
Extract new features from existing ones (e.g., day of week, month, duration in hours).
Engineer features based on domain knowledge (e.g., travel season, festival days).
Scale numerical features for better model performance.
Model Building & Evaluation

Model Selection: (Specify the chosen model types and hyperparameter tuning strategy)
Model Training & Evaluation: Train the model on the prepared data and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

Model Fine-tuning: Analyze the results and refine the model through feature selection, algorithm switching, or hyperparameter optimization.

Summarize the key findings from EDA and feature engineering.
Explain the performance of the final model with metrics and visualizations.
Discuss potential limitations and future improvements for the model.
